 Real one provides very likely the same features as their older previous version used in the Ec135 P2+T2+/ BK117 C2:

  ATT-Mode: 
  -automatic trim follow-up in hover: trim follows the pilot cyclic inputs
  -reference beep trim: pitch, roll can be changed
  -override action
  -effort against spring loads- both known also as flythrough
  Real one: AFCS moves the cyclic. Trimsystem is a magnetic clutch hold simple spring- so actually joysticks with spring are not unrealistic for this type of heli
  Only diffference: on the real one the zero-point can be shifted. Would need a force-feedback joystick or a real forcetrim cyclic stick to simulate this in FGFS
  The S-Tec 55 by Joshua Davidson shows a flythrough behavior, as the servos can be overriden there. 
  On the Eurocopters EC 145 and likely on their derivates inputs by the pilot are detected by detent switches in the paralell actuators, at around 2% it decouples the autopilot
    
  Only SAS:                                            Pilot==>cyclick stick =====================> SEMA (smart electro-mechanical actuators) provides SAS->hydraulic boost => rotor(linkage)
  AFCS with ATT-Mode or Upper Modes:    Pilot==>cyclick stick <=trim Box with parallel actuators<===AFCS computers==============================================
  
  Aka:
  Only with/ without SAS:  (as an example roll)         Pilot(controls/aileron) ===>controls/aileron-cyclic-stick====> ((via ec135/nasal/helicopter-fcs.nas -> controls/fcs/roll ) = SEMA) ==(hydraulic boost)=>aileron-cmd h135.xml

  AFCS (incl. SAS) with ATT-Mode or Upper Modes:    Pilot(controls/aileron) <==>controls/aileron-cyclic-stick (parallel actuator: can be overriden by controls/aileron; used for the virtual cyclic stick drive)<===AFCS computers (all the pid-, pi-simple-controllers and filters)
